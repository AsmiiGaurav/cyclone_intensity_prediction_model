📘 README for ThaparSat – First Student-Designed Satellite from TIET

Overview

ThaparSat is a nano-satellite project developed by a dedicated team of 25 students and 6 faculty members at Thapar Institute of Engineering & Technology, Patiala, 
under the guidance of Prof. Mamata Gulati. 
The initiative was launched in 2020 to provide hands-on experience in satellite design, development, testing, and mission planning.

Objectives & Mission

1. Monitor Greenhouse Gases: Measure real-time levels of CO₂, CH₄, and N₂O across Northern India.
2. Measure Soil Moisture: Provide data on soil moisture to support agricultural decision-making in Punjab and surrounding regions.

🌪️ Cyclone Prediction using NOAA Satellite Imagery

Role: Remote Sensing Intern at ThaparSat | Duration: June 2023 – February 2024

As part of the ThaparSat student satellite mission, I contributed to a sub-project focused on cyclone intensity prediction using satellite imagery 
and remote sensing techniques. The goal was to develop a dataset and model capable of estimating the strength of cyclones in the Indian Ocean region 
using data from the NOAA satellite.

📥 Dataset Collection & Preparation

Collected satellite imagery from NOAA-18 and GOES platforms covering active cyclones between June 2023 and February 2024.
Images included infrared and visible spectrum bands, especially channel 4 (IR longwave) for nighttime storms.
Focused on the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea regions to capture tropical cyclone activity during monsoon and post-monsoon seasons.
Sample image snippets from our dataset are included in this repository.

🛰️ Data Source & Imagery

Satellite: NOAA18
Region of Interest: Arabian Sea
Timeframe: June 2023
Image Types Used:
Thermal Infrared (10.3–11.3 µm) → Cold cloud-top analysis
False Color Composite → Structural visualization of spiral bands
Visible Imagery → Eye clarity and symmetry (daytime only)

📌 Sample IR image of Cyclone Biparjoy is included in this repository.

### 🗂️ Sample Cyclone Data

| Date       | Cyclone Name   | Image Type         | Estimated T-Value |
|------------|----------------|--------------------|-------------------|
| 2023-06-13 | Biparjoy       | Thermal IR (Band 4)| T4.5              |

🛰️ NOAA-18 Satellite Imagery Samples (April 19, 2023)
The following images demonstrate different types of satellite imagery used during the early stages of the cyclone season. These were processed as part of the cyclone prediction model using NOAA-18 data.

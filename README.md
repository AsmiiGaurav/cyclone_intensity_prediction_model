📘 README for ThaparSat – First Student-Designed Satellite from TIET

Overview

ThaparSat is a nano-satellite project developed by a dedicated team of 25 students and 6 faculty members at Thapar Institute of Engineering & Technology, Patiala, 
under the guidance of Prof. Mamata Gulati. 
The initiative was launched in 2020 to provide hands-on experience in satellite design, development, testing, and mission planning.

Objectives & Mission

1. Monitor Greenhouse Gases: Measure real-time levels of CO₂, CH₄, and N₂O across Northern India.
2. Measure Soil Moisture: Provide data on soil moisture to support agricultural decision-making in Punjab and surrounding regions.

🌪️ Cyclone Prediction using NOAA Satellite Imagery

Role: Remote Sensing Intern at ThaparSat | Duration: June 2023 – February 2024

As part of the ThaparSat student satellite mission, I contributed to a sub-project focused on cyclone intensity prediction using satellite imagery 
and remote sensing techniques. The goal was to develop a dataset and model capable of estimating the strength of cyclones in the Indian Ocean region 
using data from the NOAA satellite.

📥 Dataset Collection & Preparation

Collected satellite imagery from NOAA-18 and GOES platforms covering active cyclones between June 2023 and February 2024.
Images included infrared and visible spectrum bands, especially channel 4 (IR longwave) for nighttime storms.
Focused on the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea regions to capture tropical cyclone activity during monsoon and post-monsoon seasons.
Sample image snippets from our dataset are included in this repository.

🛰️ Data Source & Imagery

Satellite: NOAA18
Region of Interest: Arabian Sea
Timeframe: June 2023
Image Types Used:
Thermal Infrared (10.3–11.3 µm) → Cold cloud-top analysis
False Color Composite → Structural visualization of spiral bands
Visible Imagery → Eye clarity and symmetry (daytime only)
📌 Sample IR image of Cyclone Biparjoy is included in this repository.
